You are given two tables, flights and airports, with the following structure:

flights
start_port char(3) NOT NULL
end_port char(3) NOT NULL

airports
city_name varhar(17) NOT NULL
port_code char(3) NOT NULL

Each row in the table flights contains information about a flight:
code of departure (start_port)
and code of destination (end_port)

Each row in the table airports contains information about an airport:
the city name (city_name)
and the port code (port_code).

Each port_code is assigned to at most one airport.

Write an SQL query that finds all cities through which a flight
from New York
to Tokyo
may pass if the passenger wants to make exactly one change of flights.

Example:

for given tables flights:


start_port end_port
JFK NRT
LGA LAX
LAX HND
LAX HND
JFK CDG
CDG MUC
JFK HND
JFK MUC
MUC NRT

and airports:

city_name port_code
New York    JFK
New York    LGA
Paris       CDG
Tokyo       HND
Los Angeles LAX
Tokyo       NRT
Munich      MUC

your request should return:

cities
Los Angeles
Munich
